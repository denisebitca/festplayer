## Contributing

It's a hard thing to talk about honestly: I'm not very experienced with coding, so if you are willing to contribute, that's really great, but it will take me time to analyse and understand what you may have improved or not. If you are willing to give a hand, take a look at the Issues tab, I regularly update it with bugs that I find occasionally. Thank you :)
