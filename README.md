# Warning
**The master branch of festplayer is not fit for production.**
Use some of the releases instead.

## About
Festplayer is an open-source web server-localised music player made by [rdb-github](https://github.com/rdb-github) with planned remote use capabilities written with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. It's not intended for actual day-to-day use, it's a project I'm writing for a future event.

**Please be aware the project includes [getid3 v3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3), and as such is subject to [the following licenses](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/blob/master/license.txt).**

**Please be aware the project also includes [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) and [SimpleBar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar), both subject to the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).**

**Please be equally aware the project includes [material design icons](https://material.io/icons), which means that you may not package this project with any paid software or profit from it in anyway (even with the getid3 Commercial License).**

*Big thank you to [audio.js](http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/) for being part of the humble beginnings.*

## Use
Festplayer is weird. You must place your songs in **../songs**.
Make sure PHP is correctly configured.

**It is mandatory that you change the logo included with this repository (located in ./images/logo.png) after forking, if you plan to use the player publically.**
