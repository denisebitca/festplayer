## About
Festplayer is an open-source web-based music player with planned remote use capabilities written with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. It's not intended for actual day-to-day use, it's a project I'm writing for a future event.

**Please be aware the project includes [getid3 v3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3), and as such is subject to [the following licenses](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/blob/master/license.txt).**

**Please be aware the project also includes [audio.js](https://github.com/kolber/audiojs) and [SimpleBar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar), both subjected to the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).**

## Use
Festplayer is weird. You must place your songs in **../songs**.
Make sure PHP is correctly configured.

Festplayer requires an internet connection because CDNs are used.

## Website
The website won't always run the latest version of festplayer, but more often than not, it'll have it.

## FAQ

- Why does the website include a logo saying "Festicassin 2020"?

It's the aforementioned future event.
